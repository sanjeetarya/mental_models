    "summary": "This model reveals the fundamental tension between self-interest and collective benefit. It explains why cooperation is difficult to achieve and maintain, even when everyone would benefit. The key insight is that without trust, communication, or enforcement mechanisms, rational actors often choose defection over cooperation, leading to suboptimal outcomes for all.",
